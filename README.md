# Objective 
This was a learning project. My goals were:
1. Create an ExpressJS API :white_check_mark:
2. Connect a postgreSQL database with more than one table :white_check_mark:
3. Learn and apply user authentication :white_check_mark:
4. Expirement with React and make it a full-stack app :white_check_mark:
5. Deploy it successfully to Heroku :x:
    - (Authentication works fine on my local machine, but doesn't after being deployed to heroku. There seems to be a problem in the front-end request. Any help in this domain would be appreciated :thumbsup:)

## Description
This is a variation on the typical "TO-DO" app that most beginner coders make. As an music producer--and because I wanted a slight challenge--I adapted this full-stack PERN app to be a note taking app for musical ideas. A lot of my musical ideas come when listening to music. Often, I want to take an idea--a rhythm, a tone, a melody, or even a sample--from one song, and combine it with other ideas. This app allows the user to copy a link to the song or sample and leave a note next to it.
