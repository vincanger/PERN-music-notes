# Objective 
This was a learning project. My goals were:
1. Create an ExpressJS API :white_check_mark:
2. Connect a postgreSQL database with more than one table :white_check_mark:
3. Learn and apply user authentication :white_check_mark:
4. Expirement with React and make it a full-stack app :white_check_mark:
5. Deploy it successfully to Heroku :x:
    - (Authentication works fine on my local machine, but doesn't after being deployed to heroku. There seems to be a problem in the front-end request. Any help in this domain would be appreciated :thumbsup:)
